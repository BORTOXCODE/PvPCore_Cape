## Credits + Details

This was originally a private system for [FuckBeingSad](https://fuckbeingsad.club/) (friend group) which I designed.
I decided to revamp it and release it on GitHub for the public.
Please understand that this API is meant for small groups of friends, small servers, etc. This is in no way ready for production as it stores in JSON to keep things simple.
